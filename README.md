# Hexio.AspNetCore Package

A package for adding simple but powerful logging to AspNetCore applications with Serilog to Elasticsearch

This package also includes simple healthchecks

## How To Use

Make your Program.cs Main method look like this

``` cs
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
        {
            webBuilder
                .UseStartup<Startup>()
                .UseKestrel(options => options.AddServerHeader = false)
                .UseHexioDefaults();
        })
        .UseServiceProviderFactory(new AutofacServiceProviderFactory())
        .Build()
        .Run();
}
```

Then you need to setup your environment variables, e.g inside appsettings

```
{
  "Elasticsearch": {
    "Url": "http://localhost:9200",
    "Username": "CHANGEME", 
    "Password": "CHANGEME"
  }
}
```
